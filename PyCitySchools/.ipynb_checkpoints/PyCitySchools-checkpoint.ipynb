    "We can see that more spending per student, doesn't translate to better results, as the 645-680 range has by far the worst overall passing % of 66.76%. The best range was the 585-630 range which has a 73.88% overall passing %.\n",

    "Small schools (<1000 students) also seem to bring the most success with a 79.07% overall passing % and the larger the school, the lower the % with the worst overall % belonging to large schools (2000-5000 students) at 70.29%.\n",
