# pandas-challenge
Using Pandas to analyse data in Python for testing results in schools.

The Notebook used is called PyCitySchools.ipynb in the PyCitySchools folder.

Firstly summarising the student data to provide a snapshot of the Local Government Area (LGA Summary). Then we break it down to summarise by each school and then highlight the best and worst performing schools by the overall passing % across both maths and reading scores. After that we break down the data to show the math and reading scores by year level. Finally we break the data down to see what the scores are by school spending per student, school size, and school type.

There is also a written analysis of the data overall at the top of the Jupyter Notebook.
